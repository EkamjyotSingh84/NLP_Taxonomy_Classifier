# AIDI 1002 Final Project: NLP Taxonomy Classifier

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the methodology of the selected research paper by implementing a significant contribution. The focus is on improving the model's accuracy and exploring different approaches to enhance its performance. The selected research paper involves NLP techniques for text classification.


## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP_Taxonomy_Classifier.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd NLP_Taxonomy_Classifier
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Code

1. **Data Preparation:**
   Ensure that the datasets are placed in the `data/` directory. The datasets should be in the required format as specified in the research paper.

2. **Reproducing the Results:**
   Execute the Jupyter notebook `reproduce_results.ipynb` to reproduce the results from the research paper:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/reproduce_results.ipynb
   ```

3. **Running the Contribution Code:**
   To test the methodology on new datasets or to experiment with model parameters, run the script `contribution_code.py`:
   ```bash
   python src/contribution_code.py
   ```

4. **Analyzing Results:**
   Review the results and analyses in the `notebooks/` and `results/` directories.

## Contribution Details
